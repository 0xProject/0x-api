## Introduction

The 0x API is a collection of services and endpoints that can be run together or separately. In aggregate, the APIs provide interfaces to 0x liquidity, 0x staking data and more.
Everything can be run monolithically via `yarn start` and `docker-compose` up as described in [Getting Started](#getting-started).

## Services

The API contains different services that serve a collection of HTTP or websocket endpoints and keep your database in sync with [0x Mesh](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh) and Ethereum state.

### HTTP Services

These are services that handle HTTP requests and responses.

| Name                                                | Path                | Run Command                                | Requires [0x Mesh](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh)? | Requires Ethereum JSON RPC Provider? | Requires Relational Database? |

| [Standard Relayer API](https://0x.org/docs/api#sra) | `/sra`              | `yarn start:service:sra_http`              | Yes                                                       | No                                   | Yes                           |
| Staking (Not Public)                                | `/staking`          | `yarn start:service:staking_http`          | No                                                        | No                                   | Yes                           |

### Data Services

These are services that make sure the data being served is present and up-to-date by keeping the database in sync with [0x Mesh](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh) and Ethereum. With the exception of the Staking HTTP service, which has a hard dependency on the [Staking Event Pipeline](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-event-pipeline), the endpoints above run without these services, but would be providing degraded or non-functional service. There is nothing stateful about 0x API -- all the data comes from [0x Mesh](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh) or the Ethereum blockchain.

## Getting started

#### Pre-requirements

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) > v8.x
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) > v1.x
-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) > 19.x

#### Developing

To get a local development version of `0x-api` running:

1. Clone the repo.

2. Create an `.env` file and copy the content from the `.env_example` file. Defaults are defined in `config.ts`/`config.js`. The bash environment takes precedence over the `.env` file. If you run `source .env`, changes to the `.env` file will have no effect until you unset the colliding variables.

| Environment Variable                   | Default                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |

A default node is spun up in `docker-compose up`                                                                                                                    |
| `MESH_HTTP_URI`                        | Optional. No default                                            | The URL pointing to the Mesh node's HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint. Used for syncing the orderbook. If not provided, will fallback to websocket connection. A default Mesh node is spun up in `docker-compose up` |

| `META_TXN_RELAY_EXPECTED_MINED_SEC`    | Default: `120`                                                  | The expected time for a meta-txn to be included in a block.                                                                                                                                               |

| `PROMETHEUS_PORT`                      | Default: `8080`                                                 | The port from which prometheus metrics should be served.                                                                                                                                                  |

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    yarn
    ```

4. Build the project:

    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```

5) Run `docker-compose up` to run the other dependencies required for the API. This uses the local `docker-compose.yml` file. On start-up, the [event-pipeline](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-event-pipeline) container will crash and restart until Postgres is up. If you switch `CHAIN_ID` after a prior run, you will have to `rm -rf 0x_mesh postgres` to delete the volumes containing stale data.

6) Start the API

    ```sh
    yarn start
    ```

    For development:

    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

#### Developing on Ganache

Ganache is supported, but will not contain the same staking data and 0x Mesh liquidity that kovan or mainnet have for example. To use ganache, use the `.env` file below:

```
CHAIN_ID=1337
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=http://ganache:8545
```

Then run

```
$ docker-compose up
$ yarn dev
```

## Testing

Run `yarn test`. It's really that easy :)

Tip: Test suites set up and teardown sandboxed environments, so using `.only` on `it` and `describe` statements will save lots of development time.

## Commands

-   `yarn build` - Build the code
-   `yarn test` - Test the code
-   `yarn lint` - Lint the code
-   `yarn start` - Starts the API
-   `yarn dev` - Starts the API in dev-mode
-   `yarn watch` - Watch the source code and rebuild on change
-   `yarn prettier` - Auto-format the code
-   `yarn release` - Release a new version of the 0x-api

## Deployment

A Docker image is built and hosted by [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xorg/0x-api) every time a change to the `master` branch occurs. A Docker image is built, pushed and [tagged](https://hub.docker.com/r/0xorg/0x-api/tags) when a new version is [released](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/releases) as well.
Running this image will run 0x API as a monolith, with all it's dependencies. You can run any of the [services](#services) separately by [overriding the Docker command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#cmd-default-command-or-options) with the service-specific command when running the container.

## Release

Releases are triggered automatically by the [release GitHub action](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-api/actions?query=workflow%3ARelease).
They can also be triggered manually by using `yarn release`, which requires a [GITHUB_TOKEN](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) environment variable.

## Database

This project uses [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm). It makes it easier for anyone to switch out the backing database used by this project. By default, this project uses a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
